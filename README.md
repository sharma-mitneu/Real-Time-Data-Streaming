# 🚀 Realtime Data Streaming Pipeline 🚀

This project demonstrates the construction of a robust **end-to-end real-time data streaming pipeline**, designed to process and analyze data at scale. Built with modern data engineering technologies, this pipeline seamlessly integrates data ingestion, processing, storage, and orchestration to deliver reliable real-time insights.

---

## 🌟 Project Highlights
- **Technologies Used**: Apache Airflow, Python, Apache Kafka, Apache Zookeeper, Apache Spark, Cassandra, PostgreSQL, and Docker.
- **System Architecture**: A fully containerized, scalable, and fault-tolerant pipeline encompassing real-time data ingestion, distributed processing, and multi-layered storage.

---

## 🛠️ Project Components

### **1. Data Ingestion**
Real-time data ingestion is achieved using **Apache Kafka**, with **Apache Zookeeper** handling distributed synchronization for fault-tolerant message brokering.
- Kafka producers generate streams of raw data.
- Kafka topics are used to manage and distribute data to downstream systems.

### **2. Data Processing**
Data is processed in real time using **Apache Spark**.
- Spark streaming jobs perform transformations, aggregations, and filtering.
- High-throughput processing ensures the pipeline can handle large volumes of data with low latency.

### **3. Data Storage**
Processed data is stored in two databases for different purposes:
- **Cassandra**: For high-availability and scalable distributed storage.
- **PostgreSQL**: For structured data storage and querying.

### **4. Orchestration**
The entire pipeline is orchestrated using **Apache Airflow**.
- Airflow DAGs are used to define and schedule tasks.
- Provides monitoring and fault recovery to ensure pipeline reliability.

### **5. Containerization**
The pipeline is containerized using **Docker**, enabling:
- Consistent deployment across environments.
- Scalability for handling increased data loads.

## 📊 System Architecture

The architecture is designed for scalability and reliability:

1. **Producers** generate real-time data streams and send them to Kafka topics.
2. **Kafka Consumers** pull data for processing in Apache Spark.
3. Spark jobs transform and filter the data and send results to storage.
4. **Data Storage** includes Cassandra for high-availability storage and PostgreSQL for structured queries.
5. **Orchestrator** (Apache Airflow) ensures the smooth execution of all pipeline tasks.

## 🎉 Key Features
- **Fault-tolerant**: Built to handle failures gracefully, ensuring data integrity.
- **Scalable**: Handles increasing data loads efficiently with distributed components.
- **Containerized Deployment**: Easy to deploy and manage with Docker.
- **Real-time Insights**: Provides immediate analytics for decision-making.
